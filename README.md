# Free Proxies

> This repository provides a regularly refreshed list of free HTTP proxies sourced from the most widely maintained public proxy lists on GitHub. Each proxy undergoes validation to confirm connectivity and response before being added, ensuring a higher quality list compared to raw, unfiltered aggregations.

## How It Works

1. **Aggregation** — Proxies are collected from all major public GitHub proxy sources.
2. **Deduplication** — Duplicate entries across sources are removed.
3. **Validation** — Each proxy is checked for connectivity, response time, and anonymity level.
4. **Publishing** — Only proxies that pass validation are committed to this repository.


## Update Schedule

The proxy list is refreshed on a regular interval. Refer to the latest commit timestamp for the most recent update. Due to the nature of free proxies, individual entries may go offline between updates.

## Disclaimer

These proxies are provided as-is for educational and research purposes. Free public proxies carry inherent risks including instability, lack of encryption, and potential logging by the proxy operator. Do not transmit sensitive information through public proxies. Always ensure your usage complies with applicable laws and terms of service.

# Free Proxies

> A continuously updated list of free, validated HTTP proxies. Proxies are scraped from all major GitHub sources, deduplicated, and verified before publishing. Every proxy listed was confirmed working at the time of posting.


## How It Works

1. **Aggregation** — Proxies are collected from all major public GitHub proxy sources.
2. **Deduplication** — Duplicate entries across sources are removed.
3. **Validation** — Each proxy is checked for connectivity, response time, and anonymity level.
4. **Publishing** — Only proxies that pass validation are committed to this repository.


## Update Schedule

The proxy list is refreshed on a regular interval. Refer to the latest commit timestamp for the most recent update. Due to the nature of free proxies, individual entries may go offline between updates.

## Support the Project

If you find this list useful, consider leaving a star on the repository. Stars help gauge interest and directly encourage more frequent validation checks and source expansion.

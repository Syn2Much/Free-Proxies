- 🔄 **Deduplication** - Automatically removes duplicate proxies
- ⚙️ **Configurable** - Adjust workers, timeout, and verbosity
- 🕵️ **Source Analysis** - Built-in mode to identify bad, stale, or redundant proxy sources

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Syn2Much/ProxyScraper.git
cd ProxyScraper
go build -o proxywiz .
```

### Run Directly

```bash
go run .
```

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
./proxywiz
```

You'll be prompted for:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Proxy file** | Path to your proxy list (leave empty to scrape) | Auto-scrape |
| **Workers** | Number of concurrent workers | 10 |
| **Timeout** | Connection timeout in seconds | 8 |
| **Verbose** | Show detailed logging | No |
| **Source analysis** | Run source quality analysis (default sources only) | No |

## 🕵️ Source Analysis Mode

When using default sources, you can enable **source analysis mode** to evaluate the quality of every proxy source. This helps identify:

- **Dead sources** that return zero working proxies
- **Redundant sources** where all proxies are already covered by other sources
- **Overlapping pairs** that likely scrape from each other

The analysis outputs a detailed table for each source:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **TOTAL** | Total proxies the source provides |
| **UNIQ** | Proxies found only in this source |
| **WORK** | Working proxies from this source |
| **W.UNIQ** | Working proxies exclusive to this source |
| **STATUS** | `KEEP` (2+ working) or `REMOVE` (<2 working) |

Results are saved to `source_analysis.json` for further review.

### `source_analysis.json`

Per-source quality breakdown (generated by source analysis mode):

```json

    "working_unique_proxies": 21,
    "overlap_percent": 93.08,
    "status": "keep"
  }
]
```

## 🔧 Proxy File Format

Your proxy file should contain one proxy per line:

```
192.168.1.1:8080
http://proxy.example.com:3128
http://user:password@proxy.example.com:8080
https://secure-proxy.example.com:443
```

Supported formats:

- `ip:port`
- `http://ip:port`
- `https://ip:port`
- `http://user:pass@ip:port`

## ⚡ Performance Tips

| Workers | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| 10-50 | Conservative, low bandwidth |
| 100-200 | Standard usage |
| 500-10000 | High-speed connections |

**Note:** More workers = faster checking but more memory/bandwidth usage.
